# LotusNotes-VBA-Email-Sender
A collection of VBA functions for sending email through IBM Lotus Notes.

When looking for more complete functions for sending e-mail through Lotus Notes, i realized that there is a lot of information mismatched and loose on the internet.
I found many pieces, but nothing too complex. So I decided to program my own module with functions that not only meet me, but also meet those who seek them.

Feel free to use it in the best way possible and contribute to what you discover new. You can also enhance the functions present here.

<h2>Tests</h2>

All tests were done (and worked) in the following versions:

<uh>
<li>Microsoft Office 2013</li>
<li>IBM Lotus Notes (now just a IBM Notes) 9</li>
</uh>
<br>
Probably the functions also work in other versions or just need a few changes.
